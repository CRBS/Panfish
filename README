NAME
  Panfish - Multicluster job submission

SYNOPSIS

  # stages data
  panfishchum --path /home/foo -q myshadow.q

  # submits a job
  panfishcast -q myshadow.q myjob.sh
  
  # check status using Open Grid Engine command
  qstat ... 
  
  # retreives data 
  panfishland --path /home/foo -q myshadow.q


DESCRIPTION

  Panfish is a tool that enables Open Grid Engine serial jobs to be run 
  on remote clusters.

  In a standard usage scenario the user first uploads data to the 
  remote clusters via panfishchum.  The user then invokes a Panfish 
  command panfishcast to submit their jobs.  The user then monitors 
  the jobs via the id returned by the submission command using the qsub
  command.  Upon job completion the user invokes panfishland to 
  retrieve the data.  

  Run "perldoc Panfish" while in source directory before installation
  for more documentation.
