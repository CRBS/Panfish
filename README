Panfish version 0.1
====================

Panfish is a set of tools and daemons that let users submit jobs in a similar 
process they use for their local cluster, running Oracle/Sun/Open Grid Engine, 
with the advantage of those jobs optionally being sent to XSEDE compute 
clusters.  Utilizing a Panfish tool (chum) the user first uploads data to XSEDE 
compute clusters.  The user then invokes a Panfish command (cast) to submit 
their jobs.  This command is a dropin replacement for the one in 
Oracle/Sun/Open Grid Engine (qsub.) The user then monitors the jobs via the id 
returned by the submission command (cast) as with any normally submitted job.  
Upon job completion the user invokes a Panfish command (land) to retrieve the 
data.  

What happens in the above steps is the Panfish submission command (cast) submits 
what is known as a “shadow” job to a set of “shadow” queues that correspond to 
the local cluster and other XSEDE compute clusters.  Oracle/Sun/Open Grid Engine 
handles the scheduling of these “shadow” jobs to the appropriate “shadow” queue.  
Once scheduled and running these “shadow” jobs examine what queue they are under 
and let the Panfish daemon  know.  The Panfish daemon on the local compute 
cluster then submits those jobs to the corresponding compute resource notifying 
the “shadow” job upon completion.  The “shadow” job then exits letting the user 
know the work has completed.  The (chum) and (land) commands are wrappers that 
simplify the transfer of data to and from remote resources.

Panfish can be run as a cron on the local compute cluster and as a cron job on 
each remote XSEDE cluster.  The current implementation runs as a single user and 
all jobs are run as that user.  Panfish requires only ssh and rsync and no 
configuration adjustment on the remote clusters other than enabling ssh from the 
local compute resources to the remote compute resources.  



INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Panfish is designed to only work on linux operating systems that
have command line binaries for ssh and rsync.  The main installation
machine must have Sun/Oracle/Open Grid Engine 6.1+ installed and properly
configured.
